<h3>DRAGON FIGHTER v1.0 DOCUMENTATION</h3>              

<h4>1.  Introduction</h4>

You are a brave knight living in the kingdom of Holy Modo.
Your country has long been threatened by the Devil Dark
Dragon lurking in the land of unknown, where nobody has ever
explored or even known its existence. To guard the fame
and rightness of the sacred knight, you need to find out this
place - and kill the dragon! Good luck!

<h4>2.  Spec Requirements</h4>

1) Locked door: 
The cabinet is locked until you find the key in the desert to open it.

2) Hidden object:
    a. The Alexandrites Gem is hidden in the cabinet.
    b. The Sant Pete Ruby is hidden in the entrance of Bone Yard until
    you use an activated Magic Wand to reveal it.
    c. The Potion and Ark are only available in the market.

3) Incomplete object:
The Magic Wand cannot be used until it's fully activated with some kind
of magic source - which is the Potion available in the market.

4) Limited resources:
You need at least 10000 Belis (which is the currency in Holy Modo) to buy
both the Potion and Ark, but initially you only have 100 Belis. You need
to find a way to earn extra money.
